Create a “Featured Courses” section for my edtech platform using React + Tailwind CSS, with a bold, modern course card UI similar to the Physics Wallah "Arjuna JEE 2.0" card layout.

📌 IMPORTANT:
- Do not change or touch any part of the existing UI.
- Just add this new section below the "Exam Categories".

✅ SECTION LAYOUT:
- Heading: “Featured Courses”
- Grid layout: 1 card per row on mobile, 2–3 per row on desktop
- Each card must be visually rich and inspired by the PW Arjuna card style

🎴 COURSE CARD STRUCTURE:
- **Top Banner**:
  - Optional “Online” tag in top-left corner
  - Course image/banner
  - Label: e.g. “₹5,300 ₹4,900 for Complete Course” (with discount styling)

- **Middle Info Block**:
  - Course Title: e.g., “Pre-Medical 2025 Crash Course”
  - Language Badge (e.g., "Nepali", "Hinglish")
  - Student tag line (e.g., “For Class 12 & Dropper Students”)
  - Duration: “Starts on 5 July 2025 – Ends on 30 Sept 2025”

- **Price + Plans**:
  - Actual Price & Discounted Price
  - Discount badge: e.g. “8% off applied”
  - Badges like “Free”, “Pro”, “Standard” if needed

- **CTA Buttons**:
  - `Explore` → ghost style with border
  - `Buy Now` → solid style with brand color
  - Buttons should be full width and side-by-side

🎨 Tailwind Design:
- Card: `bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg overflow-hidden`
- Title: `text-xl font-bold`
- Tag badges: `bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 px-2 py-1 text-xs rounded-full`
- Button: `hover:scale-[1.02] transition transform`
- Pricing: show strikethrough on original price and green badge for discount

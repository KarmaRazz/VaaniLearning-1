You are working on a Notes Management system built with React (frontend) and Node.js + Prisma (backend). The current code has several issues related to filtering, pagination, and bulk delete. Fix all of the following:

---

✅ 1. Filter Dependency Bug:
- When a Goal is selected from the dropdown, update the Subject dropdown options to only show the subjects related to that selected goal.
- Implement this using a `useEffect` that updates subject options dynamically.

✅ 2. Filter Logic Not Working:
- Fix the filter so that:
  - When only Goal is selected, it shows all notes for that goal.
  - When only Subject is selected, it shows all notes for that subject.
  - When both are selected, it shows notes that match both Goal and Subject.

✅ 3. Bulk Delete Not Working:
- Enable multi-select delete.
- Track selected note IDs in `selectedNotes` state.
- On clicking "Delete Selected":
  - Call the backend API to delete all selected notes from the database using `prisma.note.deleteMany({ where: { id: { in: [...] } } })`.
  - Then update frontend to remove them from the list.

✅ 4. Notes Count on Header is Static:
- Fix the `Notes (20)` header so it dynamically shows the number of filtered results, not the full dataset.

✅ 5. "Showing 1 to X of Y Entries" is Wrong:
- Make this text dynamic. It should show the correct start and end indexes and total count.
  - Example: If 20 items per page and you're on page 2 of 52 total items, show: `Showing 21 to 40 of 52 entries`.

✅ 6. Pagination Issue:
- Ensure only 20 notes are shown per page.
- When navigating to the next page, display the correct subset.
- Fix logic so pages aren't empty or misaligned.

You will find the following files involved:
- `NotesPage.tsx` or `NotesPage.jsx` → UI & logic
- `notes.controller.js` → deleteMany logic
- Make sure filter logic is applied *before* pagination slicing.

Apply modular code updates, clean formatting, and add comments explaining your changes. Only fix these features. Do not modify unrelated UI or backend code.
